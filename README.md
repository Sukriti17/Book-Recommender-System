# Book-Recommender-System
This project employs collaborative filtering techniques, utilizing user-item interactions and latent factor models to provide highly personalized book recommendations.

The system is built on a Python-based stack, making use of libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data preprocessing, and Scikit-learn for implementing recommendation algorithms. The underlying dataset consists of user ratings and book metadata, carefully engineered to capture nuanced user preferences.
